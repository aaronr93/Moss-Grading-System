This project was created as an assignment for taking a list of files, concatenating the source, and sending it to a remote server for code similarity comparison using the Moss system.

It deals largely with HTTP connections in C# ASP.NET, and also with files and file directories.

NOTE: The "Upload" button will not work, because it is designed to only work in-house on Grove City College's network (specifically, to a certain server).  Normally, this would be handled gracefully.
